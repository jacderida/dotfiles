Since beginning development on UNIX based platforms, I've discovered people maintain repositories for app specific settings, and think this to be a superb idea; having it version controlled is particularly useful, because you can follow your own train of though better, if need be. My intention, as with everyone else, is to be able to get a fresh development machine (on OSX or Linux) up and running with all my custom settings, with as little as possible manual input.

At the point of writing, I'm only really beginning my venture into the UNIX based world. So, my way of doing things in these scripts may be massively unefficient or inelegant, but I intend to improve and update everything as I learn more. I'm not really prepared to fork somebody else's repository, since I want to understand how it all fits together myself.

This repository will be supplemented with my automation repository, which will aim to setup the OS and all the actual applications themselves, and do any system specific setup along those lines.
