Since beginning development on UNIX based platforms, I've discovered people maintain repositories for app specific settings, and immediately knew I had to get on the bandwagon. In particular, having it version controlled is very useful, because if you need to, you can follow your own train of thought as to why you applied some particular setting. My intention, as with everyone else, is to be able to get a fresh development machine (on OSX or Linux) up and running with all my custom settings, with as little as possible manual input; when I automate something once, I never again have to worry about remembering all the tedious little error prone steps for each set of application settings participating in the process.

At the point of writing, I'm only really beginning my venture into the UNIX based world. So, my way of doing things in these scripts may be massively unefficient or inelegant, but I intend to improve and update everything as I learn more. I'm not really prepared to fork somebody else's repository, since I want to understand how it all fits together myself.

This repository will be supplemented with my automation repository, which will aim to setup the OS and all the actual applications themselves, and do any system specific setup along those lines.
